          <span class="sub-title">...Is love really a feeling or a choice?</span>
          <br><br>
          Mr Raphael, my guy would say,"love is never a feeling but choice, nothing less nothing more" at first, 
          I tried arguing and disagreeing with him but at the end of the day, he won, I give it to him, totally. One who doesn't understand it at first like me would argue too.
          Love is a very controversial word, love is not a thing one is able or not able to do based on some magic or some chemistry, I would say it is for play(s)
          Love being a feeling does not make it right, infatuation is what I would say is a feeling. Well, I didn't come to this conclusion based only on my understanding
          and thinking but people's perspective and understanding.
          Mr Success, my colleague said, "being attracted to a person at first would be termed infatuation which we all say it is a feeling but wanting to make that
          person a part of you is totally by choice because it is not only that person that catches your attention truth be told" <br><br>
          <span class="sub-title">Now to my thoughts...</span><br><span class="sub-title">...</span>love is determination, love is a choice one makes. 
          You take someone as a partner and you choose to love them, you do not give yourself any other option(s) bacause it is actually difficult, it is never easy.
          Do not misunderstand me when I say it is not easy because in the real sense it is not. There will be fights, arguments, 
          disagreements, people better than your partner (temptations) lots of tantrums but then you choose to grab on your partner and you hang on, you love and you love hard 
          and be fulfilled while doing it.
